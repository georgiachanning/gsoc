# SageMath GSOC Final Submission

This document serves as the final submission of the GSOC'22 project <PROJECT TITLE>. This will likely be updated as I plan to keep working on this project beyond Summer of Code.

## The Arc

My proposal, which can also be seen in this repository, was for code to find edge connectivity within SageMath's graphs module. By the time Summer of Code started, that project had already been completed by my mentor, so a scope change was necessary. The first place I looked for a new project was the TO-DOs of the edge_connectivity file that was being merged. 

While we evaluated new project ideas, I read the relevant portions of [Anupam Gupta's Advanced Algorithms](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15850/notes/cmu850-f20.pdf) as well as studied more closely [Gabow's A Matroid Approach to Finding Edge Connectivity and Packing Arborescences](https://doi.org/10.1006/jcss.1995.1022) and [Anand Bhalgat, Ramesh Hariharan, Telikepalli Kavitha and Debmalya Panigrahi's Fast edge splitting and Edmonds' arborescence construction for unweighted graphs](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~debmalya/papers/soda08-splitting.pdf).

Some of the options we considered were implementing the tree-packing algorithms proposed in Gabow's work, extending the code to digraphs with multiple edges, and extending to weighted digraphs. At first, I looked into extending to multiple edges and/or to weighted graphs as this seemed like a more incremental task than implementing the tree-packing algorithm but quickly discovered that published research in these areas was very limited and ultimately not within what could be accomplished in a summer.
