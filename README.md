# SageMath GSOC Final Submission

This document serves as the final submission of the GSOC'22 project <PROJECT TITLE>. This will likely be updated as I plan to keep working on this project beyond Summer of Code.

## The Arc

My proposal, which can also be seen in this repository, was for code to find edge connectivity within SageMath's graphs module. By the time Summer of Code started, that project had already been completed by my mentor, so a scope change was necessary. The first place I looked for a new project was the TO-DOs of the edge_connectivity file that was being merged. 

While we evaluated new project ideas, I read the thing I said I was going to read (book thing) and blah blah blah.

Some of those ideas were unsolved mathematical problems, which was beyond what I could reasonably accomplish in a summer. For example, after the start of the coding period, I was researching ways to extend the edge connectivity code to work on multi-edge graphs, however...
